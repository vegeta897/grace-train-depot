	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-base-content">Terms of use</h2>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-base-content">Privacy acknowledgment</h3>
	<p>
		By using this site, you agree to the use of your Twitch identity as detailed in the
		following sections
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-base-content">Twitch account authentication</h3>
	<p>
		To use this site, you must authenticate yourself with your Twitch account. The site
		uses <em>OAuth,</em> a standard and secure account delegating protocol that lets you
		authenticate with third parties without granting access or revealing any personal
		info, such as your email address. This site requires you to log in with your Twitch
		account. In using this site, the only information you provide is your Twitch user name
		and user ID, which are both public information. This site cannot perform <em>any</em> actions
		on behalf of your Twitch account.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-base-content">User sessions</h3>
	<p>
		This site uses cookies to remember your user session, so you don't have to
		re-authenticate every time you visit it. The server logs your user session as a string
		of random characters, which only identify you on this site.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-base-content">Your content</h3>
	<p>
		The purpose of this site is for users to design custom train cars that appear on
		streams during Grace Trains.
	</p>
	<p>
		Understand that the content you create on this site is subject to being shared to
		other visitors, as well as on any streams and stream archives that use this site in an
		overlay. Your cars will be visible to anyone watching the stream. Your designs might
		also be publicly attributed (directly or indirectly) to your Twitch username both on
		the site and in streams.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-base-content">Account removal</h3>
	<p>
		You can remove your account from the site at any time, which will unlink your Twitch
		account and delete all your content. You may re-authenticate with the site afterward,
		but all your train car designs before account removal will be permanently deleted.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-base-content">Content and user moderation</h3>
	<p>
		All content created on this site is subject to removal by the content moderation team
		if it is deemed abusive. <em>Abusive</em> here means designs containing offensive or
		hurtful imagery. While using this site you must abide by the Twitch
		<a
			class="link text-base-content"
			href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/en/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a
		>, common sense, good taste, and your good judgement. The content moderation team
		reserves the right to use their judgement and discretion to determine if your content
		is abusive. Any user found to be intentionally abusing the site in any way is subject
		to having their access revoked. Your actions on this site may be used as justification
		for a ban from the host Twitch channel.
