<p>This is kinda not great</p>
<p>It won't scale up well with more tags</p>
<p>It's cramped and busy and there's too many NEW buttons</p>
<p>The car scrolling is kinda neat but not very usable</p>
<p>Maybe have a theme selector and just show one train at a time</p>
<p>Figure out how to handle many cars in one row on mobile</p>
