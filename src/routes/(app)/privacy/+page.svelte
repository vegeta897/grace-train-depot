	<p>
		This site requires you to log in with your Twitch account. This is a safe process
		known as <em>OAuth</em> that lets you verify your identity without revealing any personal
		info (not even your email) or granting unnecessary access to your account. The only information
		you give to our site is your Twitch username and a numeric Twitch ID, which is not private
		information. This site is incapable of performing any actions on behalf of your Twitch
		account.

	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">User Sessions</h3>
	<p>
		This site uses cookies to track user sessions, so you don't have to log in every time
		you visit. A session cookie just a long string of randomly generated characters. These
		strings are only meaningful to our server, which associates them with Twitch users.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Your Content</h3>
	<p>
		The content you create while on this site is subject to being shared to other
		visitors, as well as on any streams and stream archives that have an overlay utilizing
		this data. In plain terms, the point of this site is to create train car designs to
		show them in Grace Trains, and your designs may be viewed by others who visit the
		site. Your designs may be publicly attributed (directly or indirectly) to your Twitch
		username both on the site and in streams.
	</p>
	<h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Account Removal</h3>
	<p>
		You may delete your account at any time, which will remove all of your user
		information and content. You may log in with Twitch again afterwards, but your train
		car designs will be gone.
